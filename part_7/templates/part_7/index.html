            <b>Cryptography and Access Controls:</b>
        </p>
        <p>Cryptography and access controls are fundamental components of cybersecurity, providing mechanisms for securing data and controlling access to information resources. This lesson explores the principles, techniques, and applications of cryptography and access controls in safeguarding sensitive information and preventing unauthorized access.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><b>Introduction to Cryptography</b></li>
            <p>Cryptography is the science of encoding and decoding information to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. It involves the use of mathematical algorithms and techniques to transform plaintext data into ciphertext, which can only be decrypted by authorized parties possessing the corresponding decryption key.</p>
            
            <li><b>Cryptographic Techniques</b></li>
            <p>Common cryptographic techniques include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Symmetric Encryption: Uses a single encryption key to both encrypt and decrypt data, examples include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES (Data Encryption Standard).</li>
                <li>Asymmetric Encryption: Utilizes a pair of public and private keys for encryption and decryption, examples include RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).</li>
                <li>Hash Functions: Generate fixed-size hash values from input data, used for data integrity verification and password hashing, examples include SHA-256 and MD5.</li>
                <li>Digital Signatures: Provide a mechanism for verifying the authenticity and integrity of digital documents and messages, typically implemented using asymmetric encryption.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <li><b>Access Controls</b></li>
            <p>Access controls regulate user access to information resources based on predefined security policies and permissions. They include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Authentication: Verifies the identity of users attempting to access a system or resource, commonly implemented using passwords, biometrics, smart cards, or multi-factor authentication (MFA).</li>
                <li>Authorization: Determines the actions and operations that authenticated users are allowed to perform within a system or application, based on their assigned roles, privileges, and permissions.</li>
                <li>Account Management: Involves the creation, modification, and deletion of user accounts, as well as the assignment and revocation of access rights and privileges.</li>
                <li>Access Control Lists (ACLs): Specify the permissions and restrictions associated with files, directories, and network resources, controlling which users or groups are granted access.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <li><b>Implementing Cryptography and Access Controls</b></li>
            <p>Effective implementation of cryptography and access controls requires:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Security Policies: Establishing clear policies and guidelines for cryptographic key management, data encryption, access control mechanisms, and user authentication.</li>
                <li>Encryption Key Management: Implementing secure procedures for generating, storing, distributing, and revoking encryption keys to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data confidentiality.</li>
                <li>Continuous Monitoring: Monitoring and auditing cryptographic operations, access control events, and user activities to detect and respond to security incidents and policy violations.</li>
                <li>Security Awareness Training: Providing training and education to users and administrators on the importance of cryptography, access controls, and security best practices.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
