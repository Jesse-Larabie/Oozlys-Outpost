# Oozlys-Outpost
My website showcasing various projects and things that I have created!


-To start the website go type cd "C:\Users\jesse\Desktop\Oozlys Website\myproject" then python manage.py runserver. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

Url map:
http://localhost:8000/ (Home for now)
http://localhost:8000/cybersecurity/

Roadmap for Oozly's Outpost:

1.I need to create 8 sections for the different parts of the course that ar e outlined in the cyber security page, I need to figure out if all 8 of these will be there own app in django or in one, They need to all be linked to the cyber security index file.

2.I need to fix the homepage and add more info and things to interact with, the button on the top left needs a link among other things. 

3.need to make the format for both pages the same.  

4. remove the contact us form for preferably the cyber security page and only have it for the home page.
