# Portfolio-site
Website showcasing various projects and things that I have created!

Roadmap:

1:Create a threat model (Important) (https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/)

"Identify Risks Early-On
Threat modeling seeks to identify potential security issues during the design phase. This allows security to be "built-into" a system rather than "bolted-on". This is far more efficient than having to identify and resolve security flaws after a system is in production."

2:Format all parts and other pages with the updated music system.

3:Complete windows basics section.

4.Figure out how to fix main home page header

5.Upgrade overall site look and feel.

6.Learn more about css.w3 and whether I need to change or not.


The vision of the website:

I am trying to create a website that will teach visitors various programming concepts, there is various sections based one everything from Cyber security basics, operating systems, programming languages and more. The site was built with CSS.W3 which is a begginer freindly CSS library.
