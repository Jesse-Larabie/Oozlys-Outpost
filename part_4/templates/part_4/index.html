            <b>Network Security:</b>
        </p>
        <p>Network security is the practice of protecting computer networks from unauthorized access, misuse, or disruption. It encompasses various technologies, processes, and policies designed to secure data transmission, prevent network attacks, and safeguard network infrastructure. This lesson provides an overview of key concepts and principles of network security, including threats, vulnerabilities, security measures, and best practices.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><b>Introduction to Network Security</b></li>
            <p>Network security is essential for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data transmitted over computer networks. It involves implementing security measures to protect network infrastructure, devices, and communication channels from security threats and attacks.</p>
            
            <li><b>Common Network Security Threats</b></li>
            <p>Networks face various security threats and vulnerabilities, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Malware: Malicious software such as viruses, worms, Trojans, and ransomware that can infect network devices and compromise data.</li>
                <li>Hackers and Intruders: Unauthorized individuals or entities attempting to gain unauthorized access to network resources for malicious purposes.</li>
                <li>Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks: Attacks that disrupt network services by overwhelming network resources or exploiting vulnerabilities in network protocols.</li>
                <li>Phishing and Social Engineering: Techniques used to trick users into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise network security.</li>
                <li>Data Breaches: Unauthorized access or disclosure of confidential information, resulting in data theft, loss, or exposure.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <li><b>Network Security Measures and Controls</b></li>
            <p>Effective network security requires the implementation of various security measures and controls:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Firewalls: Network security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.</li>
                <li>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS): Security systems that detect and respond to suspicious activities or potential security breaches in real-time.</li>
                <li>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): Encrypted communication channels that allow remote users to securely access corporate networks over the internet.</li>
                <li>Encryption: Techniques used to encode data transmitted over network connections to prevent unauthorized interception or eavesdropping.</li>
                <li>Access Control: Mechanisms for controlling user access to network resources based on user authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <li><b>Security Best Practices</b></li>
            <p>Network security best practices help organizations mitigate security risks and protect their networks from potential threats:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Regular Security Audits: Conducting periodic security assessments and audits to identify vulnerabilities, assess risks, and ensure compliance with security policies and standards.</li>
                <li>Employee Training and Awareness: Providing security awareness training to employees to educate them about security risks, best practices, and their role in maintaining network security.</li>
                <li>Incident Response Planning: Developing and implementing incident response plans to detect, contain, and mitigate security incidents effectively.</li>
                <li>Updates and Patch Management: Applying security patches, updates, and software upgrades regularly to address known vulnerabilities and security weaknesses.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
